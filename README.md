# 🔐 Learn RSA: Rivest–Shamir–Adleman Cryptosystem

RSA is one of the most widely used **public-key cryptosystems** in the world. It enables **secure data transmission** by using **asymmetric encryption** – with a **public key** for encryption and a **private key** for decryption.

This repository is your **one-stop guide to mastering RSA**, from foundational math to real-world cryptanalysis and coding.
